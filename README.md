Autonomous Drone Navigation

Introduction

The Autonomous Drone Navigation project focuses on developing a drone system that can navigate independently using GPS, computer vision, and real-time sensor data. This project aims to enhance autonomous flight capabilities for various applications, including surveillance, mapping, and emergency response.

Features

GPS-Based Navigation: The drone follows a predefined flight path using GPS coordinates.

Obstacle Avoidance: Integrated sensors detect and avoid obstacles in real time.

Autonomous Takeoff and Landing: The drone is capable of launching and landing without manual intervention.

Real-Time Data Processing: The onboard system processes video feeds and sensor data for efficient navigation.

Remote Monitoring & Control: Users can track the droneâ€™s flight status via a web-based dashboard.

Technologies Used

Hardware:

Standard drone with GPS, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), and camera module.

LiDAR/Ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection.

Software:

Python (for control logic and ML-based navigation improvements)

OpenCV (for real-time visual processing)

ROS (Robot Operating System for drone automation)

React (for the web-based monitoring dashboard)

Setup Instructions

Drone Configuration:

Ensure the drone is equipped with GPS, a camera, and obstacle sensors.

Load the navigation control software onto the onboard processor.

Launch the Navigation System:

Start the autonomous navigation module:

python drone_navigation.py

Access the web dashboard:
html
css 
js 
flask
Usage

The drone autonomously takes off and follows a predefined GPS route.

It detects and avoids obstacles during the flight.

The user can monitor real-time drone status and control parameters via the dashboard.

Future Enhancements

Implementation of AI-driven dynamic path planning.
